                (see status)

GROUP           1: Data from SWOG 8591 (aka Int - 0035)
                2: Data from NCCTG

(*) You can name the variables whatever you want.  Most of the names are
from the original SAS dataset.  

@STRATNO -- possible values range from 1-24

If stratno is in (2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23) then lymph nodes = 1-4, if
stratno is in (3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24) then lymph nodes > 4.  If stratno
is in (1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22) then lymph nodes = 0(by definition of
dukes B).

If stratno is in 1-12 then days from surgery to registration = "7-20
days", otherwise if stratno is in 13-24 then days from surgery to
registration = "21-30 days".

This additional information is useful because some patients have a
missing value for "number of positive lymph nodes" or "resection
date".  By using a patient's stratification number, one is able to
categorize the patient without knowing the exact value.
